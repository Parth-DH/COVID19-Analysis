# COVID19-Analysis
There are 3 main analytics that were carried out:
1) Finding out the total number of active COVID-19 cases given daily data from various countries.
2) Finding out the number of cases in a given date range
3) Find the total number of cases per capita given population data (populations.csv)

Task 2 and 3 were carried out using both Spark and Hadoop.

## Timings and Usage 

Here are the various timings as well as the usage directions for the hadoop and spark tasks. I timed both the implementations using the time functionality in the terminal commands by adding time before my commands. I have listed the real times and not the user or system times for these processes. Clearly, Spark processes were running upto 3 times faster as compared to Hadoop processes.

Hadoop 1 - 25.184s
hadoop jar ./libexec/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-3.2.1.jar -file /Users/parth/Downloads/Covid19_mapper1.py -mapper '/Users/parth/Downloads/Covid19_mapper1.py "false"' -file /Users/parth/Downloads/Covid19_reducer1.py  -reducer /Users/parth/Downloads/Covid19_reducer1.py  -input hw/covid19_full_data.csv -output hw/output 

Hadoop 2 - 24.096s
